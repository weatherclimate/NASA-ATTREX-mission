The Airborne Tropical TRopopause EXperiment (ATTREX) was a series of measurement campaigns 
conducted from 2011 to 2015 using NASA's long-range Global Hawk (GH) unmanned aircraft system (UAS) 
to enhance understanding of stratospheric water vapor and its impact on Earth's energy budget and climate.
